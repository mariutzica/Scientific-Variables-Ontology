    rdfs:comment "In mathematics, the slope or gradient of a line is a number that describes both the direction and the steepness of the line. Slope is often denoted by the letter m; there is no clear answer to the question why the letter m is used for slope, but its earliest use in English appears in O'Brien (1844) who wrote the equation of a straight line as \"y = mx + b\" and it can also be found in Todhunter (1888) who wrote it as \"y = mx + c\".Slope is calculated by finding the ratio of the \"vertical change\" to the \"horizontal change\" between (any) two distinct points on a line.  Sometimes the ratio is expressed as a quotient (\"rise over run\"), giving the same number for every two distinct points on the same line.  A line that is decreasing has a negative \"rise\".  The line may be practical â€“ as set by a road surveyor, or in a diagram that models a road or a roof either as a description or as a plan."^^xsd:string .
