  <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Income is the consumption and saving opportunity gained by an entity within a specified timeframe, which is generally expressed in monetary terms. Income is difficult to define conceptually and the definition may be different across fields. For example, a person's income in an economic sense may be different from their income as defined by law.An extremely important definition of income is Haigâ€“Simons income, which defines income as Consumption + Change in net worth and is widely used in economics.For households and individuals in the United States, income is defined by tax law as a sum that includes any wage, salary, profit, interest payment, rent, or other form of earnings received in a calendar year. Discretionary income is often  defined as gross income minus taxes and other deductions (e.g., mandatory pension contributions), and is widely used as a basis to compare the welfare of taxpayers.</rdfs:comment>
