    rdfs:comment "In astrophysics, the thermal time scale or Kelvin–Helmholtz time scale is the approximate time it takes for a star to radiate away its total kinetic energy content at its current luminosity rate.  Along with the nuclear and free-fall (aka dynamical) time scales, it is used to estimate the length of time a particular star will remain in a certain phase of its life and its lifespan if hypothetical conditions are met.  In reality, the lifespan of a star is greater than what is estimated by the thermal time scale because as one fuel becomes scarce, another will generally take its place – hydrogen burning gives way to helium burning, which is replaced by carbon burning."^^xsd:string .
