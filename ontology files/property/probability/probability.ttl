    rdfs:comment "Probability is the branch of mathematics concerning events and numerical descriptions of how likely they are to occur.  The probability of an event is a number between 0 and 1; the larger the probability, the more likely an event is to occur. The higher the probability of an event, the more likely it is that the event will occur. A simple example is the tossing of a fair (unbiased) coin. Since the coin is fair, the two outcomes (\"heads\" and \"tails\") are both equally probable; the probability of \"heads\" equals the probability of \"tails\"; and since no other outcomes are possible, the probability of either \"heads\" or \"tails\" is 1/2 (which could also be written as 0.5 or 50%)."^^xsd:string .
