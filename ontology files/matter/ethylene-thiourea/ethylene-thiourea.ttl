    rdfs:comment "Ethylene thiourea (ETU) is an organosulfur compound with the formula C3H6N2S. It is an example of an N,N-disubstituted thiourea.  It is a white solid.  It is synthesized by treating ethylenediamine with carbon disulfide.Ethylene thioureas are an excellent accelerant of vulcanization of neoprene rubbers.  In commercial use is the N,N'-diphenylethylenethiourea. Due to reproductive toxicity, carcinogenicity, and mutagenicity, alternatives are being sought to the ethylenethioureas.  One candidate replacement is N-methyl-2-thiazolidinethione.Ethylene thiourea can be used as a biomarker of exposure to ethylenebisdithiocarbamates (EBDTCs), which are frequently employed as fungicides in agriculture, mainly on fruits, vegetables and ornamental plants."^^xsd:string .
