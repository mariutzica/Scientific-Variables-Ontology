    rdfs:comment "Propoxur (Baygon) is a carbamate non-systemic insecticide, produced from catechol, and was introduced in 1959. It has a fast knockdown and long residual effect, and is used against turf, forestry, and household pests and fleas. It is also used in pest control for domestic animals, Anopheles mosquitoes, ants, gypsy moths, and other agricultural pests. It can also be used as a molluscicide.Several U.S. states have petitioned the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to use propoxur against bedbug infestations, but the EPA has been reluctant to approve indoor use because of its potential toxicity to children after chronic exposure."^^xsd:string .
