    rdfs:comment "Acetonitrile, often abbreviated MeCN (methyl cyanide), is the chemical compound with the formula CH3CN and structure H3C−C≡N. This colourless liquid is the simplest organic nitrile (hydrogen cyanide is a simpler nitrile, but the cyanide anion is not classed as organic). It is produced mainly as a byproduct of acrylonitrile manufacture. It is used as a polar aprotic solvent in organic synthesis and in the purification of butadiene. The N≡C−C skeleton is linear with a short C≡N distance of 1.16 Å.Acetonitrile was first prepared in 1847 by the French chemist Jean-Baptiste Dumas."^^xsd:string .
