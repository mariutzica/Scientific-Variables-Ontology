    rdfs:comment "Hexazinone is an organic compound that is used as a broad spectrum herbicide.  It is a colorless solid.  It exhibits some solubility in water but is highly soluble in most organic solvents except alkanes.  A member of the triazine class herbicides, it is manufactured by DuPont and sold under the trade name Velpar.It functions by inhibiting photosynthesis and thus is a nonselective herbicide.  It is used to control grasses, broadleaf, and woody plants. In the United States approximately 33% is used on alfalfa, 31% in forestry, 29% in industrial areas, 4% on rangeland and pastures, and < 2% on sugarcane.Hexazinone is a pervasive groundwater contaminant. Use of hexazinone causes groundwater to be at high risk of contamination due to the high leaching potential it exhibits."^^xsd:string .
