    rdfs:comment "Decane is an alkane hydrocarbon with the chemical formula C10H22.  Although 75 structural isomers are possible for decane, the term usually refers to the normal-decane (\"n-decane\"), with the formula CH3(CH2)8CH3.  All isomers, however, exhibit similar properties and little attention is paid to the composition. These isomers  are flammable liquids. Decane is present in small quantities (less than 1%) in gasoline (petrol) and kerosene.  Like other alkanes, it is a nonpolar solvent, and does not dissolve in water, and is readily combustible.  Although it is a component of fuels, it is of little importance as a chemical feedstock, unlike a handful of other alkanes."^^xsd:string .
