    rdfs:comment "Natural hafnium (72Hf) consists of five stable isotopes (176Hf, 177Hf, 178Hf, 179Hf, and 180Hf) and one very long-lived radioisotope, 174Hf, with a half-life of 7.0×1016 years. In addition, there are 30 known synthetic radioisotopes, the most stable of which is 182Hf with a half-life of 8.9×106 years. This extinct radionuclide is used in hafnium–tungsten dating to study the chronology of planetary differentiation.No other radioisotope has a half-life over 1.87 years. Most isotopes have half-lives under 1 minute. There are also 26 known nuclear isomers, the most stable of which is 178m2Hf with a half-life of 31 years. All isotopes of hafnium are either radioactive or observationally stable, meaning that they are predicted to be radioactive but no actual decay has been observed."^^xsd:string .
