    rdfs:comment "Mercury is a chemical element with the symbol Hg and atomic number 80. It is also known as quicksilver and was formerly named hydrargyrum ( hy-DRAR-jər-əm) from the Greek words hydorcode: ell promoted to code: el  (water) and argyroscode: ell promoted to code: el  (silver). A heavy, silvery d-block element, mercury is the only metallic element that is known to be liquid at standard temperature and pressure; the only other element that is liquid under these conditions is the halogen bromine, though metals such as caesium, gallium, and rubidium melt just above room temperature."^^xsd:string .
