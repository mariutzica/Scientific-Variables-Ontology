    rdfs:comment "Bromacil is an organic compound with the chemical formula C9H13BrN2O2, commercially available as a herbicide. Bromacil was first registered as a pesticide in the U.S. in 1961. It is used for brush control on non-cropland areas. It works by interfering with photosynthesis by entering the plant through the root zone and moving throughout the plant. Bromacil is one of a group of compounds called substituted uracils. These materials are broad spectrum herbicides used for nonselective weed and brush control on non-croplands, as well as for selective weed control on a limited number of crops, such as citrus fruit and pineapple. Bromacil is also found to be excellent at controlling perennial grasses."^^xsd:string .
