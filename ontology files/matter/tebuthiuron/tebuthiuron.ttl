    rdfs:comment "Tebuthiuron is a nonselective broad spectrum herbicide of the urea class.  It is used in a number of herbicides manufactured by Dow AgroSciences, and is sold under several trade names, depending on the formulation.  It is used to control weeds, woody and herbaceous plants, and sugar cane. It is absorbed by the roots and transported to the leaves, where it inhibits photosynthesis.The Environmental Protection Agency considers tebuthiuron to have a great potential for groundwater contamination, due to its high water solubility, low adsorption to soil particles, and high persistence in soil (its soil half-life is 360 days)."^^xsd:string .
