    rdfs:comment "Tetrachloroethylene, also known under the systematic name tetrachloroethene, or perchloroethylene, and abbreviations such as \"perc\" (or \"PERC\"), and \"PCE\", is a chlorocarbon with the formula Cl2C=CCl2. It is a colorless liquid widely used for dry cleaning of fabrics, hence it is sometimes called \"dry-cleaning fluid\". It also has its uses as an effective automotive brake cleaner. It has a sweet odor, similar to the smell of chloroform, detectable by most people at a concentration of 1 part per million (1 ppm). Worldwide production was about 1 million metric tons (980,000 long tons; 1,100,000 short tons) in 1985."^^xsd:string .
