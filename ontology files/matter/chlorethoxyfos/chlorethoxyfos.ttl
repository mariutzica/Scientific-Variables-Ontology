    rdfs:comment "Chlorethoxyfos (O,O-diethyl-O-(1,2,2,2-tetrachloroethyl)phosphorothioate) is an organophosphate acetylcholinesterase inhibitor used as an insecticide. It is registered for the control of corn rootworms, wireworms, cutworms, seed corn maggot, white grubs and symphylans on corn. The insecticide is sold under the trade name Fortress by E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company.Annual domestic usage of chlorethoxyfos is estimated to range from 8,500 to 17,800 pounds of active ingredient for approximately 37,000 to 122,000 acres treated. Approximately 1% of all corn acreage is treated.Chlorethoxyfos has a O-alkyl phosphorothioate type of phosphorus group which makes it similar to compounds such as chlorpyriphos-methyl, coumaphos, diazinon, dichlofenthion, fenitrothion, fenthion, parathion, parathion-methyl, pyrazophos, pyrimiphos-methyl, sulfotep, temephos, and thionazin.The compound does not have EU regulatory approval for use as an insecticide as it can be harmful for the aquatic environment and is deemed very toxic for humans."^^xsd:string .
