As a medication it is used to treat scabies and lice. For scabies either permethrin or malathion is typically preferred. It is applied to the skin as a lotion. Typically two to three applications are needed. It is also present in Balsam of Peru, Tolu balsam, and in a number of flowers.Side effects may include irritation of the skin. It is not recommended in children. It is also used in other animals; however, it is considered toxic to cats. How it works is unclear.Benzyl benzoate was first studied medically in 1918. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Benzyl benzoate is sold under the brand name Scabanca among others and is available as a generic medication.
