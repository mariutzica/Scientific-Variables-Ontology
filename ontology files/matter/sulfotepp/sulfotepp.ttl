    rdfs:comment "Sulfotep (also known as tetraethyldithiopyrophosphate and TEDP) is a pesticide commonly used in greenhouses as a fumigant. The substance is also known as Dithione, Dithiophos, and many other names. Sulfotep has the molecular formula C8H20O5P2S2 and belongs to the organophosphate class of chemicals. It has a cholinergic effect, involving depression of the cholinesterase activity of the peripheral and central nervous system of insects.  The transduction of signals is disturbed at the synapses that make use of acetylcholine.  Sulfotep is a mobile oil that is pale yellow-colored and smells like garlic. It is primarily used as an insecticide."^^xsd:string .
