Many inorganic chlorides are salts.  Many organic compounds are chlorides. The pronunciation of the word \"chloride\" is .The chloride ion is an anion (negatively charged ion) with the charge Cl-. Chloride salts such as sodium chloride are often soluble in water. It is an essential electrolyte located in all body fluids responsible for maintaining acid/base balance, transmitting nerve impulses and regulating liquid flow in and out of cells. Other examples of ionic chlorides are calcium chloride CaCl2 and ammonium chloride [NH4]Cl."^^xsd:string .
