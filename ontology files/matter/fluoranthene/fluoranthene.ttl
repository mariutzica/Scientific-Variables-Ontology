    rdfs:comment "Fluoranthene is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH).  The molecule can be viewed as the fusion of naphthalene and benzene unit connected by a five-membered ring. Although samples are often pale yellow, the compound is colorless.  It is soluble in nonpolar organic solvents.  It is a member of the class of PAHs known as non-alternant PAHs because it has rings other than those with six carbon atoms. It is a structural isomer of the alternant PAH pyrene. It is not as thermodynamically stable as pyrene.  Its name is derived from its fluorescence under UV light."^^xsd:string .
