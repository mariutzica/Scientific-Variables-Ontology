    rdfs:comment "Methocarbamol, sold under the brand name Robaxin among others, is a medication used for short-term musculoskeletal pain. It may be used together with rest, physical therapy, and pain medication. It is less preferred in low back pain. It has limited use for rheumatoid arthritis and cerebral palsy. Effects generally begin within half an hour. It is taken by mouth or injection into a vein.Common side effect include headaches, sleepiness, and dizziness. Serious side effects may include anaphylaxis, liver problems, confusion, and seizures. Use is not recommended in pregnancy and breastfeeding. Because of risk of injury, skeletal muscle relaxants should generally be avoided in geriatric patients. Methocarbamol is a centrally acting muscle relaxant. How it works is unclear, but it does not appear to affect muscles directly."^^xsd:string .
