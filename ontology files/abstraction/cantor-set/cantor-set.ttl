    rdfs:comment "In mathematics, the Cantor set is a set of points lying on a single line segment that has a number of unintuitive properties.  It was discovered in 1874 by Henry John Stephen Smith and introduced by German mathematician Georg Cantor in 1883.Through consideration of this set, Cantor and others helped lay the foundations of modern point-set topology. The most common construction is the Cantor ternary set, built by removing the middle third of a line segment and then repeating the process with the remaining shorter segments. Cantor mentioned the ternary construction only in passing, as an example of a more general idea, that of a perfect set that is nowhere dense."^^xsd:string .
