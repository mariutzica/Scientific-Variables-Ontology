    rdfs:comment "In materials science, a thermosetting polymer, often called a thermoset, is a polymer that is obtained by irreversibly hardening (\"curing\") a soft solid or viscous liquid prepolymer (resin). Curing is induced by heat or suitable radiation and may be promoted by high pressure or mixing with a catalyst. Heat is not necessarily applied externally, and is often generated by the reaction of the resin with a curing agent (catalyst, hardener). Curing results in chemical reactions that create extensive cross-linking between polymer chains to produce an infusible and insoluble polymer network."^^xsd:string .
