    rdfs:comment "Forging is a manufacturing process involving the shaping of metal using localized compressive forces.  The blows are delivered with a hammer (often a power hammer) or a die.  Forging is often classified according to the temperature at which it is performed: cold forging (a type of cold working), warm forging, or hot forging (a type of hot working). For the latter two, the metal is heated, usually in a forge. Forged parts can range in weight from less than a kilogram to hundreds of metric tons. Forging has been done by smiths for millennia; the traditional products were kitchenware, hardware, hand tools, edged weapons, cymbals, and jewellery."^^xsd:string .
