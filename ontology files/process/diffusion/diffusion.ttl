    rdfs:comment "Diffusion is the net movement of anything (for example, atoms, ions, molecules, energy) generally from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration. Diffusion is driven by a gradient in Gibbs free energy or chemical potential. In the context of Quantum Physics, diffusion refers to spreading of wave packets. In simplest example, a Gaussian wave packet will spread along the spatial dimensions, as time progresses, resulting in diffusion of the wave packet energy. It is possible to diffuse \"uphill\" from a region of lower concentration to a region of higher concentration, like in spinodal decomposition. Diffusion is a stochastic process due to the inherent randomness of the diffusing entity and can be used to model many real-life stochastic scenarios. Therefore, diffusion and the corresponding mathematical models are used in several fields, beyond physics, such as statistics, probability theory, information theory, neural networks, finance and marketing etc."^^xsd:string .
