    rdfs:comment "A treefall gap is a distinguishable hole in the canopy of a forest with vertical sides extending through all levels down to an average height of 2 m (6.6 ft) above ground. These holes occur as result of a fallen tree or large limb. The ecologist who developed this definition used two meters because he believed that \"a regrowth height of 2 m was sufficient\" for a gap to be considered closed, but not all scientists agree. For example, Runkle believed that regrowth should be 10–20 m (33–66 ft) above the ground. Alternatively, a treefall gap is \"the smallest gap [that must] be readily distinguishable amid the complexity of forest structure.\"There is no upper limit in gap size. However, it must be caused by a tree or a large limb. For example, a field would not be considered a treefall gap. Tree falls are commonly caused by old age, natural hazards, or parasitic plants (or certain epiphytes)."^^xsd:string .
