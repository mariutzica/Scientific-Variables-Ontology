    rdfs:comment "A small domestic appliance, also known as a small electric appliance or minor appliance or simply a small appliance, small domestic or  small electric, is a portable or semi-portable machine, generally used on table-tops, counter-tops or other platforms, to accomplish a household task. Examples include microwave ovens, kettles, toasters, humidifiers, food processors and coffeemakers. They contrast with major appliances (known as \"white goods\" in the UK), such as the refrigerators and washing machines, which cannot be easily moved and are generally placed on the floor.  Small appliances also contrast with consumer electronics (British \"brown goods\") which are for leisure and entertainment rather than purely practical tasks."^^xsd:string .
