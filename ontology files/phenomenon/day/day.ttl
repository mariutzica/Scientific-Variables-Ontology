    rdfs:comment "A day is the time period of a full rotation of the Earth with respect to the Sun.  On average, this is 24 hours, 1440 minutes, or 86,400 seconds. In everyday life, the word \"day\" often refers to a solar day, which is the length between two solar noons or times the Sun reaches the highest point. The word \"day\" may also refer to daytime, a time period when the location receives direct and indirect sunlight. On Earth, as a location passes through its day, it experiences morning, noon, afternoon, evening, and night. The effect of a day is vital to many life processes, which is called the circadian rhythm."^^xsd:string .
