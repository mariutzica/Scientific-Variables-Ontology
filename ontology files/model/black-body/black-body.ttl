    rdfs:comment "A black body or blackbody is an idealized physical body that absorbs all incident electromagnetic radiation, regardless of frequency or angle of incidence. The radiation emitted by a black body in thermal equilibrium with its environment is called black-body radiation. The name \"black body\" is given because it absorbs all colors of light. In contrast, a white body is one with a \"rough surface that reflects all incident rays completely and uniformly in all directions.\"A black body in thermal equilibrium (that is, at a constant temperature) emits electromagnetic black-body radiation. The radiation is emitted according to Planck's law, meaning that it has a spectrum that is determined by the temperature alone (see figure at right), not by the body's shape or composition."^^xsd:string .
