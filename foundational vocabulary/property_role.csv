,constant,constant,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_constant,"A constant is the opposite of a variable. A constant cannot be a parameter, but it can be a coefficient or an exponent. A physical constant is, in its widest scope, a property of the known universe. A mathematical constant is abstract and may be a property of the known mathematical universe used to describe the known physical universe. See https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-the-universe-made-of-math-excerpt/"

,parameter,parameter,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter,dictionary definition: a quantity whose value is selected for the particular circumstances and in relation to which other variable quantities may be expressed. A parameter plays a specific role within a particular application. A parameter can be a coefficient or an exponent.
,term,term,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_(logic),"Coefficient and exponent have different roles in an equation or expression. Term is more generic and usually describes a component that is part of a summation/subtraction (see addend, summand), although its usage could be broader."

,dimension,dimension,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension,"Terms in this category describe the cardinality or rank of a mathematical or physical space. Think: degrees of freedom, order of a polynomial, dimension of a vector space. Examples: the Hausdorff dimension corresponds to the property surface roughness"

,dimensionless_number,dimensionless_number,,A value that results from a ratio of two (compound) numbers in the same dimension. A factor is a kind of dimensionless number that is also a coefficient. DNs can be coefficients or exponents and may be parameters in a model as well â€”see e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dimensionless_quantities. They may also be physical constants: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionless_physical_constant
