,dimensionless_number,dimensionless_number,quantitative,,A value that results from a ratio of two (compound) numbers in the same dimension. A factor is a kind of dimensionless number that is also a coefficient. DNs can be coefficients or exponents and may be parameters in a model as well â€”see e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dimensionless_quantities. They may also be physical constants: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionless_physical_constant
