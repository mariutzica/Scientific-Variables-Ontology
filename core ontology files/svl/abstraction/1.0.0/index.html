            This is the documentation for the Abstraction Ontology. All instances of the Abstraction class are 
                listed here. An abstraction is a mental mathematical model that is applied to observed phenomena
                to approximate the spatiotemporal behavior of that phenomenon. Abstractions that are derived from
                physical theories are physical abstractions.

The term boundary operation refers to finding or taking the boundary of a set.  Notations used for boundary of a set S include bd(S), fr(S), and ∂S.
