            This is the documentation for the Relationship Ontology. All instances of the Relationship class are 
                listed here. Relationships can be temporal or spatial or both and are used to define the Relationship 
                between the Phenomenon of interest and the <a href="http://www.geoscienceontology.org/svo/svl/context">Context</a> or <a href="http://www.geoscienceontology.org/svo/svl/reference">Reference</a> phenomenon in those constructs.
