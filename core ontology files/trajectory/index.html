            This is the documentation for the Trajectory Ontology. All instances of the Trajectory class are 
                listed here. Trajectory is a spatiotemporal phenomenon that describes the 
                motion trajectory of one ore more spatial phenomena in space and time.

            <em>In physics, an orbit is the gravitationally curved trajectory of an object, such as the trajectory of a planet around a star or a natural satellite around a planet. Normally, orbit refers to a regularly repeating trajectory, although it may also refer to a non-repeating trajectory.</em>

            <em>A trajectory or flight path is the path that an object with mass in motion follows through space as a function of time. In classical mechanics, a trajectory is defined by Hamiltonian mechanics via canonical coordinates; hence, a complete trajectory is defined by position and momentum, simultaneously.</em>

            <em>A transect is a path along which one counts and records occurrences of the species of study (e.g. plants).It requires an observer to move along a fixed path and to count occurrences along the path and, at the same time (in some procedures), obtain the distance of the object from the path.</em>
