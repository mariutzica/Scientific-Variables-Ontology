            This is the documentation for the Role Phenomenon Ontology. All instances of the Role Phenomenon class are 
                listed here. Role Phenomena are temporal phenomena that can be combined with different spatial phenomena to identify
                the way a phenomenon behaves in a scenario of interest. Whereas the Role class is dedicated to describing the
                generic roles that participants take in a described process, the Role Phenomenon class is dedicated to describing
                mental construct that is applied to the functionality of a phenomenon for an intended application.

In conventional use, this also includes deviation of reflected radiation from the angle predicted by the law of reflection.</em>

                        <em>Scuba diving is a mode of underwater diving where the diver uses a self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (scuba), which is completely independent of surface supply, to breathe underwater. Scuba divers carry their own source of breathing gas, usually compressed air, allowing them greater independence and freedom of movement than surface-supplied divers, and longer underwater endurance than breath-hold divers.</em>
