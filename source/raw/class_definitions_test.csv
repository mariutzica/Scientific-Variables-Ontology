class_name,definition
Abstraction,"An abstraction is a mathematical/simplified representation of a (spatial or spatiotemporal) Phenomenon."
Attribute,"An Attribute is a construct for attaching a Property and associated value(s) to a Phenomenon to specify a Phenomenon's state."
Direction,"A Direction is the orientation of a Phenomenon's trajectory."
Domain,"A Domain is a field of knowledge."
Form,"A Form is an attribute that identifies the spatial extent (shape) of a Phenomenon to determine the boundaries and the amount of matter encompassed by that Phenomenon."
Matter,"Matter is an attribute that identifies the substance, essence, or stuff of which a Phenomenon is made."
Model,"A Model is an Abstraction that accounts for the properties of a Phenomenon and is used to study the Phenomenon's characteristics."
Operation,"An Operation is a mathematical transformation that acts on a quantity."
Part,"A Part is an attribute that identifies a generic component of a whole Phenomenon."
Phenomenon,"A Phenomenon is anything (concrete, or arising from the properties of the Universe) that can be or is observed to exist or happen in the physical universe and that has an independent existence."
Process,"A Process is an act or activity in which a Phenomenon participates that changes the state of that phenomenon."
Property,"A Property is any characteristic or quality of a Phenomenon. Properties can be quantitative or qualitative."
PropertyQuantification,"A Property Quantification is a measure of a Property that is used to convert a qualitative property into a quantity."
PropertyRole,"A Property Role describes the function of a property within a Model."
PropertyType,"A Property Type is a characteristic that determines the values that a Property may take."
Role,"A Role is an attribute that identifies the behavior, usage, or tendency of a Phenomenon indicating action rather than substance or form."
Trajectory,"A Trajectory is an attribute that describes the spatiotemporal evolution of the Process undergone by a Phenomenon."
Variable,"A Scientific Variable is an identifier for a Property-Phenomenon pairing that indicates a unique physical system and/or abstraction of a physical system and a corresponding characteristic of interest."
