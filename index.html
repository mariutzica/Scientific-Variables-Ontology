<p>Hello and welcome to the new home of the Scientific Variables Ontology!<p>

<p>This site is currently under construction. Please check back soon!</p>

<p>In the meantime, feel free to browse our old website content <a href='website'>here</a>. Because the content has been archived, some links may be broken. The SPARQL endpoint and variable matching APIs have been disabled; however, all of the code required to run these services locally has been provided on GitHub.</p>
