                listed here. The part class is reserved for concepts that can be applied to a Body or an Abstraction,
                but that in and of themselves do not hold meaning. Examples include 
                bottom and top. Entities that sufficiently describe
                concepts in and of themselves but that are parts of other concepts are 
                attached to those concepts using the <a href="../context/index.html">context</a> construct.

More precisely, it is the set of points in the closure of S not belonging to the interior of S.  An element of the boundary of S is called a boundary point of S.  The term boundary operation refers to finding or taking the boundary of a set.  Notations used for boundary of a set S include bd(S), fr(S), and ∂S.  Some authors (for example Willard, in General Topology) use the term frontier instead of boundary in an attempt to avoid confusion with the concept of boundary used in algebraic topology and manifold theory.</em>

In the Earth's atmosphere, the atmospheric boundary layer is the air layer near the ground affected by diurnal heat, moisture or momentum transfer to or from the surface.</em>
