amphids always post-labial,  shape, pore-like to elaborate
deirids are not seen
phasmids are generally absent
hypodermal glands present (excretory?) uninucleate
simple non-tubular excretory system when present
three caudal glands commonly opening through a spinneret at the tail tip
male generally has two testes
caudal alae are rare
male with supplement glands in a single ventro-median row
sensory papillae in cephalic region and along the body
generally there are five esophageal glands
marine, freshwater, terrestrialAs it seems, a number of these traits are plesiomorphic, and thus unsuitable to discern relationships.</em>
