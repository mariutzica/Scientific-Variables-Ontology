            This is the documentation for the Process Ontology. All instances of the Process class are
                listed here. Process is a temporal phenomenon that describes the trajectory of one ore more
                spatial phenomena in space and time. If you would like to browse some notes on the linguistic cues
                of the Process category, please refer to the <a href="https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/CSN_Process_Names">

                        <em>Biomagnification, also known as bioamplification or biological magnification, is the increasing concentration of a substance, such as a toxic chemical, in the tissues of tolerant organisms at successively higher levels in a food chain. This increase can occur as a result of:

Persistence â€“ where the substance cannot be broken down by environmental processes
Food chain energetics â€“ where the substance's concentration increases progressively as it moves up a food chain
Low or non-existent rate of internal degradation or excretion of the substance â€“ mainly due to water-insolubility
Biological magnification often refers to the process whereby certain substances such as pesticides or heavy metals work their way into lakes, rivers and the ocean, and then move up the food chain in progressively greater concentrations as they are incorporated into the diet of aquatic organisms such as zooplankton, which in turn are eaten perhaps by fish, which then may be eaten by bigger fish, large birds, animals, or humans.</em>
