            This is the documentation for the Trajectory Ontology. All instances of the Trajectory class are
                listed here. Trajectory is a spatiotemporal phenomenon that describes the
                motion trajectory of one ore more spatial phenomena in space and time.

                        <em>The ecliptic is the mean plane of the apparent path in the Earth's sky that the Sun follows over the course of one year; it is the basis of the ecliptic coordinate system. This plane of reference is coplanar with Earth's orbit around the Sun (and hence the Sun's apparent path around Earth).</em>

                        <em>In physics, an orbit is the gravitationally curved trajectory of an object, such as the trajectory of a planet around a star or a natural satellite around a planet. Normally, orbit refers to a regularly repeating trajectory, although it may also refer to a non-repeating trajectory.</em>

A trajectory or flight path is the path that an object with mass in motion follows through space as a function of time.
